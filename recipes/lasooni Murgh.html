    <h1><center>Garlic Flavored Spicy Chicken</center></h1>
    <p>This traditional Indian dish was suggested to me by my friend from Mumbai. It is creamy and full of flavor and should be served over some kind of carb (rice, potatoes, naan) to absorb and dissimulate the spice. It can be easily done in a vegetarian version by substituting the chicken with potatoes, broccoli, spinach and/or paneer. I garnish it with cilantro leaves and grated cheese.</p>

    <h4>Step1:</h4>
    <p>Stir together the yogurt, garlic paste, lemon juice, garam masala, white pepper, and saffron; season to taste with salt. Toss the chicken in the yogurt and marinate in the refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours.</p>
    <h4>Step2:</h4>
    <p>Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Toss in the cumin seeds and allow to cook until fragrant, 20 to 30 seconds. Add the chicken and brown in the oil. Discard any remaining marinade. Turn heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Pour in the cream and heat through. Serve immediately.</p>
